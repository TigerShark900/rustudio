# Credits: original files used

rustudio is the person's own editor for their Roblox places. Nothing from
Roblox Studio is copied into this folder or compiled into the program. The
files below, from the Studio install at
`/home/user/.local/share/rustudio/studio` (RobloxStudioBeta.exe's folder),
are read at run time only, through `~/.local/share/rustudio/content` (a link
the person made to Studio's `content/` folder; `RUSTUDIO_CONTENT_DIR` points
it elsewhere).

| File in the game's folder | Used for |
|---|---|
| `content/fonts/*.mesh` (e.g. `content/fonts/torso.mesh`, `leftarm.mesh`, `rightarm.mesh`, `sword.mesh`, `rocketlauncher.mesh`) | `rbxasset://fonts/…` meshes that places reference (SpecialMesh / MeshPart) |
| `content/textures/*` (e.g. `content/textures/face.png`, `SwordTexture.png`, `rocketlaunchertex.png`, `water/normal_21.dds`) | `rbxasset://textures/…` images on parts, decals and meshes |
| `content/sounds/*` | `rbxasset://sounds/…` sounds played by Sound instances |
| `content/fonts/families/*.json` | named by `Font` / `FontFace` values (`rbxasset://fonts/families/…`): which face file holds each weight and style |
| `content/fonts/*.ttf`, `content/fonts/*.otf` (e.g. `Oswald-Regular.ttf`, `Sarpanch-Regular.ttf`, `BuilderExtended-Bold.otf`, `Montserrat-Bold.ttf`) | the text of TextLabels, TextButtons and TextBoxes in GUIs, drawn with the same font files Studio uses |
| `content/fonts/BuilderSans-Regular.otf`, `SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf`, `NotoSans*UI-Regular.ttf`, `NotoNaskhArabicUI-Regular.ttf` | fallback glyphs for GUI text whose font lacks a character (e.g. "▶" in Sarpanch), after the text's own font |

System fonts, read at run time when installed (not part of Studio or
rustudio): `NotoSansSymbols2-Regular.ttf`, `NotoSansSymbols-Regular.ttf`
(Noto, SIL OFL) and `DejaVuSans.ttf` (DejaVu, Bitstream Vera licence) under
`/usr/share/fonts`, as the last fallbacks for symbols in GUI text and the
editor's own text.

Read straight from the Studio install at run time (read only, never
copied; found as `RUSTUDIO_STUDIO_DIR`, else the folder the content link
points into, else the copy rustudio downloads on first run from Roblox's
deployment CDN into `~/.local/share/rustudio/studio` (`src/studio_content.rs`),
else `~/.local/share/rustudio/studio`):

| File in the game's folder | Used for |
|---|---|
| `ExtraContent/scripts/PlayerScripts/StarterPlayerScripts/PlayerScriptsLoader.lua`, `PlayerModule.module.lua` and the `PlayerModule.module/` folder (CameraModule, ControlModule, CommonUtils) | Roblox's default player controller, put into StarterPlayerScripts at Play as Studio does |
| `ExtraContent/scripts/PlayerScripts/StarterPlayerScriptsCommon/RbxCharacterSounds.lua` (+ `RbxCharacterSounds/AtomicBinding.lua`) | the default character sounds script |
| `content/avatar/scripts/humanoidHealthRegenScript.rbxmx`, `humanoidAnimateR15_DEPRECATED_20260813.rbxm`, `humanoidAnimatePlayEmote.rbxm` | the Health and Animate scripts each character gets |
| `PlatformContent/pc/textures/studs.dds` | legacy surfaces (Studs, Inlet, Weld, Glue, Universal) on parts |
| `PlatformContent/pc/terrain/materials.json` | default terrain colours (`base_color`) |
| `content/avatar/characterR15DynamicHeadV2.rbxm`, `content/avatar/defaultDynamicHead.rbxm` | Roblox's default R15 body for characters in Play (body-part MeshParts, WrapTarget cages, attachments, Motor6Ds) and its head |
| `content/avatar/character.rbxm`, `content/avatar/heads/head.mesh` | Roblox's default R6 body, and the mesh drawn for SpecialMesh MeshType Head |
| `ReflectionMetadata.xml` | the Insert Object popup's categories (ClassCategory) and the Explorer's sibling order (ExplorerOrder) |
| `content/fonts/BuilderSans-Regular.otf`, `BuilderSans-Bold.otf` (through the content link) | the editor's own text, as Studio's panels and ribbon use |

Rules and default values read from RobloxStudioBeta.exe's code and data
(camera speed settings, the fly speed-up rule, wheel zoom, snap increments;
listed with their addresses in `docs/MECHANICS.md`) are written into rustudio's
own code; no Studio code is copied. Values measured from Studio rather than
read from its files (listed with
their sources in `docs/MECHANICS.md` and `mechanics.json`): camera speed, wheel
step, field of view, snap increments, part defaults, theme colours, Studio's
settings in an offline Studio's `appdata/Roblox/GlobalSettings_13.xml`, and Output
messages seen while playing og.rbxl and Place A in an offline Studio. The fidelity
captures in `../checks/compare/*/studio/` (screenshots, Output, structural
dumps, physics facts) are Studio's own, taken offline in an offline Studio by
`tools/fidelity/fidelity.py`; the R15 hip height, part sizes, resting height,
jump apex, fall time and walk speed used in code come from them.

Downloaded at run time from Roblox's public asset delivery (no login;
`docs/MATERIALS.md`) and cached in `~/.cache/rustudio/assets`: the material
texture packs named in RobloxStudioBeta.exe's material tables and their
images, the default animations Roblox's Animate scripts ask for, the body
part meshes and cages the body files above point at, and any other public
asset a place uses. The material tables (pack ids, colours), the HACD
collision settings and the material texture repeat were read from
RobloxStudioBeta.exe and its shader pack (`shaders/shaders_glsl3.pack`, read
while studying, not at run time); the values are written into rustudio's own
code with their addresses in `docs/MECHANICS.md`.

With the person's own Roblox session (`docs/AUTH.md`; signed in only), the same
endpoint also gives assets Roblox serves to signed-in accounts: the current
dynamic head of the R15 body file (mesh, cage, face), the person's avatar
items (clothing, accessories, layered clothing), models a place loads with
InsertService, and the person's own places. Those meshes are often
Draco-compressed; they are decoded with the `draco-core` crate (Apache-2.0,
a Rust reading of Google's Draco format). The self-test's "catalog-assets"
step puts on Roblox's catalog item "Hooded Jacket - Gray" (8516620262). The
place-upload route `/ide/publish/UploadExistingAsset` was read from
RobloxStudioBeta.exe's strings to test publishing (`docs/AUTH.md`).

Other files read at run time, outside the game's folder: the offline Studio's local asset
store `~/.local/share/rustudio/assets/<id>[.ext]` and the person's rbxasset
upload ledger `~/.local/share/rbxasset/ledger.json` with the files it points
at (FBX model uploads among them, imported in memory). All read only:
rustudio writes nothing into either.

GUI measurements (top bar inset, text widths) were taken from Studio in
an offline Studio; Place A' own notes on its uploads (Shared/GunMeshes, GrenadeArt)
confirmed how Roblox places imported FBX meshes.
